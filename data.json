    "description": "After seeing all the abstract art I immediately thought of the album cover Unknown Pleasures made by Peter Saville. It inspired this piece where I took the use of for-loop to generate wavy lines with Perlin noise which updates everytime you reload the website. The loops generate smooth, repeating curves on a black background with white strokes. "

    "description": "In VOL 2 I made another variation of the album. I added different colours, the strokes simulate ocean waves with a sandy beach background. To make it more realistic the waves are moving by using a framecount. "
