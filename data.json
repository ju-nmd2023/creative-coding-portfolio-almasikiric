    "description": "After seeing all the abstract art I immediately thought of the album cover Unknown Pleasures made by Peter Saville. It inspired this piece where I took the use of for-loop to generate wavy lines with Perlin noise which updates everytime you reload the website. The loops generate smooth, repeating curves on a black background with white strokes. "
